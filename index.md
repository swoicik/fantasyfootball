## Money
The yearly cost of the league is $200. This amount is due at the conclusion of the previous season. For example the 22-23 payment is due at the conclusion of the 21-22 season. The next season will not start until all teams have paid. The money collected will be paid out with the following schedule;

| Place       | Payout    |
| ---         | ---       |
| 1st Place   | $1,480.00 |
| 2nd Place   | $600.00   |
| 3rd Place   | $200.00   |

### Dynasty Pot

$10 from every payment is put into a Dynasty Pot. This is paid out when a team wins two years in a row. If a team wins two years in a row the pot resets.

For example if a team win two years in a row, they are paid the Dynasty Pot in addition to the 1st Place payout. The team will then have to win two seasons in a row again to win the Dynasty Pot. Winning a third year in a row will not win the Dynasty Pot again.

## League Roll Over
The league will be rolled over for the next season after the Super Bowl and all teams have paid league buy in. Once the league has been rolled over for the new season, all waivers will be on the off season schedule. No rookies are able to be added to the team until after the Rookie Draft.

## Rosters
Each team has a roster of 10 Starters, 9 Bench, 3 IR, and 6 Taxi Squad. For a team to participate in off-season transactions (trades and waivers) they must have a roster constructed within these limits. Before the first NFL game of the season, all teams must be in compliance with the roster constraints.

### Free Agent Acquisition Budget (FAAB)
Each team is given a $1000 Free Agent Acquisition Budget. This budget will be used for all off-season and in-season waiver claim.

When making a waiver claim you will blind bid using your available FAAB for the player you wish to add. Highest bid will win the waiver claim for that player.

FAAB may also be used in trades.

FAAB will reset at the end of each season. FAAB does not carry over from year to year. Whatever you don't use in the current season is lost.

### Taxi Squad
Each team has a Taxi Squad of 6 players. Players are only eligible for the Taxi Squad if they are in their first 3 years of the NFL.

In season, players may no longer be added to the Taxi Squad. You are allowed to move a playing from the Taxi Squad to your active bench. You may not move a different player to your Taxi Squad though. 

### Trades
Trading between teams is allowed during the season and off-season. Trading is suspended from week 12 to the end of the season. Every trade has a 24 hour review period after being accepted by each team involved in the trade. This 24 hour period can be waived if each team involved in the trade messages the commissioner to push the trade through. The 24 hours review is only to prevent mistakes, not stop trades from happening.

Trading is allowed with roster players, draft picks (up to three years in advance), and FAAB.

## Rule Changes and Voting
Nothing is perfect and rules will change. Any suggestion or idea for a rule change can be brought up in the group chat or communicated with the commissioner.

If there is enough interest, the rule will go to a vote. Only the commissioner can hold a vote for a rule change.

Voting is decided my majority. 8 out of the 12 members are needed for any rule change to pass.

### 2022
- The league voted 8-4 in favor of expanding the Taxi Squad from 4 players to 6 players.
- The league voted 12-0 in favor of expanding the eligibility of Taxi Squad players from 2 year to 3 years.

### 2021
- The league voted 8-3 in favor of raising the yearly buy in
- The league voted 8-4 in favor of making the yearly buy in $200.00
- The league voted 10-0 in favor of making pick trading allowed for up to 3 years in advances. If you trade a pick from a future year, the buy in for that year is owed before the trade is processed.
