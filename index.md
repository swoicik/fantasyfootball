## Money
The yearly cost of the league is $200. This amount is due at the conclution of the previous season. For example the 22-23 payment is due at the conclusion of the 21-22 season. The next season will not start until all teams have paid. The money collected will be paid out with the following schedule;

| Place       | Payout    |
| ---         | ---       |
| 1st Place   | $1,480.00 |
| 2nd Place   | $600.00   |
| 3rd Place   | $200.00   |

### Dynasty Pot

$10 from every payment is put into a Dynasty Pot. This is paid out when a team wins two years in a row. If a team wins two years in a row the pot resets.

For example if a team win two years in a row, they are paid the Dynasty Pot in addition to the 1st Place payout. The team will then have to win two seasons in a row again to win the Dynasty Pot. Winning a third year in a row will not win the Dynasty Pot again.

## League Roll Over
The league will be rolled over for the next season after the Super Bowl and all teams have paid league buy in. Once the league has been rolled over for the new season, all waviers will be on the off season schedule. No rookies are able to be added to the team until after the Rookie Draft. 

## Rosters
Each team has a roster of 10 Starters, 9 Bench, 3 IR, and 6 Taxi Squad. For a team to participate in off-season transactions (trades and waivers) they must have a roster contructed within these limits. Before the first NFL game of the season, all teams must be in compliance with the roster contraints.

## Rule Changes and Voting
Nothing is perfect and rules will change. Any suggestion or idea for a rule change can be brought up in the group chat or communicated with the commissioner.

If there is enough interest, the rule will go to a vote. Only the commissioner can hold a vote for a rule change.

Voting is decided my majority. 8 out of the 12 members are needed for any rule change to pass.
